# Sonic R Autosplitter v1
This is an autosplitter for the 2004 release of Sonic R. It will work with the Sonic R Updater. Support for the 1998 version may be added in an update. Credits to Daily for starting the splitter (and whoever else helped him. I couldn't really find anyone else).
## Behavior
* Starts splits when selecting the stage.
* Triggers a split when completing the third lap.
* Optional auto-reset when choosing "Retire" from the pause menu.
* IGT support pulled from the in-game timer.
